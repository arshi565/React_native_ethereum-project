# React_native_ethereum-project
This is a simple React Native app that demonstrates how to send Ether from one account to another using the Ethereum blockchain. The app includes a screen with input fields for the transaction amount and recipient address, as well as a button to initiate the transaction.

Getting Started
To run this app on your local machine, you'll need to follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
Open the App.js file in a code editor and replace YOUR_PROVIDER_URL and YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY with your own values.
Connect your Android or iOS device to your computer and enable USB debugging. Alternatively, you can use an Android or iOS emulator to run the app.
Run react-native run-android or react-native run-ios in the project directory to build and run the app on your device or emulator.
Usage
Once you've installed and launched the app, you can use it to send Ether to another Ethereum address. Here's how:

Enter the amount of Ether you want to send in the "Enter amount" input field.
Enter the recipient's Ethereum address in the "Enter recipient address" input field.
Tap the "Send Ether" button to initiate the transaction.
Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. The app will display the transaction status as either "pending" or "completed".
Security Considerations
Please note that this app is intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment. In particular, the private key is hard-coded in the App.js file for demonstration purposes only, and you should never hard-code your private key in any code that will be publicly accessible. Instead, you should use a secure method for storing and accessing your private key, such as a hardware wallet or a secure enclave.
